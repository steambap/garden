## Intro
Grow your citrus and pick as much citrus as you can by overlapping other trees bearing the same fruit. The more you overlap, the greater your harvest will be. Inspired by [GROVE: A 9 card solitaire game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/329873/grove-9-card-solitaire-game)

## How to Play
- Try to add the hand pieces (bottom left) to the main board to score.

- You can rotate your hand piece 60 degree before add it to the main board.

- Empty space can overlap with anything.

- The color of the citrus in that hex must match the one underneath it, if both of them are not empty space.

- Score is calculate by adding the fruit count.

- If the score value would exceed ‘6’ then it becomes ‘10’. If a ‘10’ is overlapped then it becomes ‘15’. You cannot go over 15 on any hex.

- Game end once your have placed 9 hand pieces onto the main board.
